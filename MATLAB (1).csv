        pane. When you check Automatically handle rate transition for data
          transfer, Simulink inserts Rate Transition blocks between blocks when rate transitions are
        detected. Simulink handles rate transitions for asynchronous and periodic tasks. Simulink adds the hidden blocks configured to ensure data integrity and determinism for
        data transfers. When you check Treat each discrete rate as a separate
          task, Simulink selects multitasking execution for models operating at different rates. It

        each stage of simulation (for example, calculating output and updating states) based on task
        priority."

numbers. Fixed-Point Designer™ stores them as doubles with the scaling,
sign, and word length information retained. For example, the storage
container for a fixed-point data type sfix16_En14 is int16.
The storage container of the equivalent scaled doubles data type, flts16_En14 is
floating-point double. Fixed-Point Designer applies
the scaling information to the stored floating-point double to obtain
the real-world value. Storing the value in a double almost always
eliminates overflow and precision issues."
